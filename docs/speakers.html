            <p class="ms-5 mb-2 d-none d-lg-block"><b>Founder and CEO of The Fish Farmer</b></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-5">
            Mr Malcolm Ong graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with an engineering degree 
            in 1988. He started his career as an IT engineer. Subsequently, he won a scholarship to study in 
            England from 1994 to 1995 and graduated with an MBA from the University of Bradford. Later, he 
            joined a start-up company in 1996 and grew the company to $20 million in revenue. In 2007, he sold 
            all his shares in the IT company to a big French group.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            After being in IT for nearly 20 years, Mr Ong started looking for a career switch. This led him to 
            pursue his passion for fishing, culminating in the establishment of what would grow to be one of the 
            biggest aquaculture companies in Asia, The Fish Farmer. This was also prompted by his concerns over 
            reports that our oceans are being depleted at an alarming rate.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            With the growing world population and more people becoming affluent, there is a higher demand for 
            fish as it is deemed a healthy food option. Singapore imports a staggering 96 percent of seafood 
            from overseas. The Fish Farmer has been feeding Singapore since 2007 when it was first founded. Now 
            the company has a total of four farms located off the waters of Lim Chu Kang and Changi that are 
            capable of producing 1,000 tonnes of fish annually which includes grey mullet, milk fish, red snapper, 
            Barramundi and sea perch. 
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            The Fish Farmer’s unique business proposition is to cultivate and market fishes in a natural, 
            responsible and sustainable way. The fishes at The Fish Farmer are nurtured without any growth 
            enhancements. Leaning on his IT and engineering expertise, Mr Ong transformed his business to an 
            elevated and more sustainable level by integrating traditional fish farming with advanced technology 
            and modernisation. More than 70 percent of the farms are made of recycled materials, and the water 
            monitoring system of each farm is solar-powered and designed for a low energy footprint.

            <p class="ms-5 mb-2 d-none d-lg-block"><b>Co-founder of Just Dabao</b></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-5">
            Ms Jennifer Widjaja is a self-driven and focused individual who is passionate about sustainable 
            livelihood in Asia. Getting a simple yet life-changing product into the hands of millions of people 
            and making small changes in their lives is her reason to wake up everyday.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Knowing that food waste has become a national issue, Ms Widjaja researched the F&B scene during 
            the Circuit Breaker in 2020 and investigated the food waste problem in Singapore. She interviewed 
            consumers, ran focus groups and created surveys to develop a deeper understanding of the food waste
            problem.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            When her friend, an F&B merchant, had to shut down her business at the height of the pandemic, 
            she ended up throwing away stocks of food.That incident spurred Ms Widjaja to come up with a 
            sustainable and fun solution for this problem. 
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            In August 2020, she co-founded Just Dabao - a business that connects buyers with over 400 eateries, 
            helping them sell food which would otherwise go to waste. Food at Just Dabao is sold at an average of 
            50 percent off to help merchants maximise sales and reduce losses. Acknowledging people’s familiarity 
            and love for food, the company aims to remodel sustainability as people’s first choice without 
            compromising on their lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">Prior to starting Just Dabao, Ms Widjaja was a financial analyst in Bloomberg. 
            Her previous work experience include working at Procter and Gamble as an assistant manager of HR 
            and at HRnet as an associate consultant. She was also a business development intern in Little Sparrows 
            Technologies, a digital marketing intern at Blibli and a marketing intern at UBS Wealth Management.

        </div>
        <p class="mt-5">
            Ms Yeo is a social entrepreneur who believes strongly in developing self-awareness and looking 
            within ourselves to reach our potential. In 2017, she co-founded UglyFood, a social enterprise that 
            aims to eliminate food waste by raising awareness to reduce the stigma around bruised produce. 
            To date, 400 tonnes of produce have been rescued from going to waste.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Ms Yeo left UglyFood in 2021 after serving as Director of Operations for over three years. 
            During that time, the company expanded its supply base and began taking on excess produce from farms, 
            which would normally go to waste. Thereafter, she continued working on multiple projects that promote 
            food sustainability.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            She started Food Warrior in 2021, which aims to empower the youth to explore opportunities in the 
            food sustainability space. She is also part of the team behind UglyDuck Cafe - a community cafe with 
            focus on food sustainability and community engagement. 
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Ms Yeo has worked with SJI for the 2020 Year 3 IP Signum Fidei Program where students proposed 
            ideas about implementing sustainability practices in the school.
