            This experiment aims to determine the gravitational field strength on Earth by measuring the time taken for a tennis ball to hit the ground from a range of known heights.

        <i>1.2 Background Information</i><br>
            When bodies near Earth’s surface are released, they are primarily affected by gravity. 
            In this experiment, we assume the effect of air resistance and other forces
            to be negligible for tennis balls travelling at low velocities (&#8804 15 m s<sup>-1</sup>) 
            during freefall. As such, these balls only have the Earth’s gravitational attraction acting on them, resulting in a constant rate of change of velocity. As acceleration and gravity on a body are both directly proportional to mass, this acceleration is solely based on gravitational field strength and irrespective of mass. 
            <br class="small-spacing">

        <hr class="small-space">
        <p>
            In this <b>gravitational freefall</b>, we can relate the constant acceleration of the body (<b>a</b>) to its change in displacement (<b>s</b>) and initial velocity (<b>u</b>) through the kinematic equation:
            <div class="equation">
                <p>s = ut + &#189at<sup>2</sup></p>
            </div>
            When the bodies start from rest, we get the equation:
            <div class="equation">
                s = &#189at<sup>2</sup>
            </div>
            Lastly, when gravity is the only force acting on bodies in freefall, and the resultant displacement of a body is equal to its original height above the ground, we get
            <div class="equation">
                h = &#189gt<sup>2</sup>
            </div>
            where h is the initial height of the body, and g is gravitational acceleration on Earth.<br>
            As such, by obtaining the initial height and time in freefall of a tennis ball, we can calculate the value of gravitational field strength.

            <i>1.3 Variables</i>
            <br>In this experiment, our <u>independent variable</u> is the distance travelled in freefall, which is equivalent to the initial height of the 
            ball above the ground.  For a precise derivation of gravitational acceleration 
            with low uncertainty, the ball is dropped from a large range of heights between 0.860 and 7.235m. The <u>dependent variable</u> is the time taken for the ball to hit the ground. This is measured using a digital stopwatch, thus introducing various sources of error (see section  <b>3.3</b>). <br>
            To prevent the influence of other factors on our results, several variables were kept constant. For example, the same tennis balls were used for all attempts to ensure consistent motion in freefall. Additionally, the person dropping the ball and measuring the time before contact with the ground were kept the same across all attempts, ensuring consistent measurements of time. <br>

            To conduct this experiment, several equipment were loaned to us from the Physics Laboratory:

        <p>Our procedure was as follows:</p>
        <ol id="procedure">
            <li>Tie a pendulum bob to the end of a non-elastic string</li>
            <li>In an open space next to a building, lower the pendulum bob over a railing to the ground floor, until it is barely touching the ground directly below. As a safety precaution, ensure that no one is standing below the bob while it is being lowered.</li>
            <li>Stretch out an arm over the railing, resting it firmly on a wall (preferred) or the railing. Ensure that no part of your torso goes over the railing at <b>any point in time</b>. Do not move your arm after settling it in place.</li>
            <li>After ensuring that the string is pulled taut and is directly over the bob, mark the length of string equivalent to the height of the ball above the ground.</li>
            <li>Pull the pendulum bob back up</li>
            <li>When ready, the person dropping the ball counts down from 3 to 1. After the count of 1, start the timer and drop the ball at the same time.</li>
            <li>When the ball hits the ground, stop the timer</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 two more times at the same height with the remaining tennis balls.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2 - 8 at five different heights, ensuring that the range of heights used is as large as possible.</li>
            <li>Using a metre ruler, measure the lengths of string denoted by the various markings on it.</li>
